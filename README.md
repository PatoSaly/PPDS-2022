## Preparation of environment

We are working on the assignment with Python version ```3.10.2```.
I have created a virtual environment into which we installed
the necessary modules.

- fei.ppds

The resulting project is versioned and stored on GitHub,
with each branch (outside the master) containing one assignment from the exercise.
The virtual environment is shared by the entire project, i.e. all branches.
